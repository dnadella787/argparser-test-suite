Testing suite that I am currently working on for the argparse library I wrote. It is using googletest
with a CMake build system. Once done, I will integrate this into the main argparser repository.

THINGS TO DO:
- add exception catching to the original library
- change name of argparser_test.cpp to store_action_test.cpp or something
