Testing suite that I am currently working on for the argparse library I wrote. It is using googletest
with a CMake build system. Once done, I will integrate this into the main argparser repository.

THINGS TO DO:
- change name of argparser_test.cpp to store_action_test.cpp or something
- test is_required for store
- test other death test cases for store
